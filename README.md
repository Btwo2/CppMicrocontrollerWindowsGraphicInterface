A rudimentary easy-to-use graphic interface developed to record and plot data. The interface allows plotting real-time data received by a microcontroller via USB. We implemented additionally to the real-time plotting an option to define axis as static or dynamic, some data correction option for parameterization, a recording data option and a load saved data option. Finally, as a proof-of-concept we used Freescale Freedom FDRM-KL25Z but any microcontroller can communicate to this interface using an USB cable.
