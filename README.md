# C++ Microcrontroller Graphic Interface for Windows

An easy-to-use rudimentar graphic interface developed to record and plot data. This interface allows ploting real-time data recieved by a microcontroller and plot a graphic. We implemented additionally to the real-time plotting a recording data option, a load saved data option and allowing to choose between creating a static or a dynamic axis when recording new data. Finally, as a proof-of-concept we used Freescale Freedom FDRM-KL25Z but any microcontroller can communicate to this interface using an USB cable.
